    <h1>Die Wende</h1>
    <p>
      The Peaceful Revolution (German: Friedliche Revolution) was the process of
      sociopolitical change that led to the opening of East Germany's borders
      with the west, the end of the
      <span>Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED)</span> in the German
      Democratic Republic (East Germany) and the transition to a parliamentary
      democracy, which enabled the reunification of Germany in October 1990.
      This happened through non-violent initiatives and demonstrations. This
      period of change is also referred to in German as Die Wende (German
      pronunciation: [diː ˈvɛndə], "the turning point"). These events were
      closely linked to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's decision to abandon
      Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe as well as the reformist movements that
      spread through Eastern Bloc countries. In addition to the Soviet Union's
      shift in foreign policy, the GDR's lack of competitiveness in the global
      market, as well as its sharply rising national debt, hastened the
      destabilization of the SED's one-party state. Those driving the reform
      process within the GDR included intellectuals and church figures who had
      been in underground opposition for several years, people attempting to
      flee the country, and peaceful demonstrators who were no longer willing to
      yield to the threat of violence and repression. East Germany's economy was
      stronger than other Eastern Bloc countries and it was the most successful
      of the CMEA countries. It was the Soviet Union's most important trading
      partner, although it was very much subordinate. It was a net exporter of
      technology. Its shared language, cultural and personal connections with
      West Germany helped to boost its economy.[16] Its trade with West Germany
      was 50 to 60 percent of its total trade with Western nations.[17]

    <h2>Soviet policy toward the Eastern Bloc</h2>
    <p>
      A fundamental shift in Soviet policy toward the Eastern Bloc nations under
      Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s was the prelude to widespread
      demonstrations against the Socialist Unity Party, which had ruled East
      Germany since the country was founded on 7 October 1949.[1] Previous
      uprisings - East Germany (1953), Czechoslovakia (1953), Poland (1956),
      Hungary (1956) and the Prague Spring (1968) - were harshly put down by
      Soviet troops.[10] The Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–1981
      was already one of non-intervention.[11] A fundamental shift in Soviet

    <h2>East German reaction to Soviet reforms</h2>
    <p>
      Following the reforms, by 1988 relations had soured between Gorbachev and
      Honecker, although the relationship of KGB and the Stasi was still
      close.[14] In November 1988, the distribution of the Soviet monthly
      magazine Sputnik, was prohibited in East Germany because its new open
      political criticisms annoyed upper circles of the GDR leadership. This
      caused a lot of resentment and helped to activate the opposition movement.
      After a year, the sale of the magazine was reinstated, and censored
      editions of the issues from the preceding year were made available in a
      special edition for East Germans.[15] Following the reforms, by 1988

    <h2>Situation in the GDR</h2>
    <p>
      After his election as Minister President in the People's Chamber on 13
      November 1989, Hans Modrow affirmed on 16 November that, from the GDR
      viewpoint, reunification was not on the agenda. Since the end of October,
      opposition groups had called for the creation of a round table. They
      released a communal statement: "In light of the critical situation in our
      country, which can no longer be controlled by the previous power and
      responsibility structures, we demand that representatives of the GDR
      population come together to negotiate at a round table, to established
      conditions for constitutional reform and for free elections." After his
