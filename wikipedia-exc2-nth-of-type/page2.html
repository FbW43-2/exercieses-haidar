    <h1>Catalysts for the crisis of 1989</h1>
    <h2>Economic situation</h2>
    <p>
      East Germany's economy was stronger than other Eastern Bloc countries and
      it was the most successful of the CMEA countries. It was the Soviet
      Union's most important trading partner, although it was very much
      subordinate. It was a net exporter of technology. Its shared language,
      cultural and personal connections with West Germany helped to boost its
      economy.[16] Its trade with West Germany was 50 to 60 percent of its total
      trade with Western nations.[17]

    <h2>Electoral fraud</h2>

      In practice,
      <span
        >there was no real choice in GDR elections, which consisted of citizens
        voting to approve a pre-selected list of "National Front"
        candidates.</span
      >
      The National Front was, in theory, an alliance of political parties, but
      they were all controlled by the SED party, which controlled the
      Volkskammer, the East German parliament. The results of elections were
      generally about 99% "Yes" in favour of the list. However, prior to the 7
      May 1989 election there were open signs of citizens' dissatisfaction with
      the government and the SED was concerned that there could be a significant
      number of "No" votes. The number of applications for an "Ausreiseantrag"
      (permission to leave the country) had increased and there was discontent
      about housing conditions and shortages of basic products.[20] In practice,

    <h2>Gaps in the Iron Curtain</h2>
    <p>
      The Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc states had strongly isolationist
      policies and they developed complex systems and infrastructure to restrict
      their citizens travel beyond the Iron Curtain.[23] About 3.5 million
      people left the GDR for West Germany before the building of the Berlin
      Wall and the Inner German border in August 1961. After that it was still
      possible to leave legally, by applying for an Ausreiseantrag [de]
      (permission to leave). Between 1961 and 1988 about 383,000 people left
      this way.[24][Note 1]The Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc states had

    <h2>Opening of the Hungarian and Czechoslovak borders</h2>
    <p>
      The Hungarian leader, János Kádár, retired on 22 May 1988 and other
      political parties were formed which challenged the old socialist order in
      Hungary, leading to a period of liberalisation.[29] Almost a year later,
      on 2 May 1989, the Hungarian government began dismantling its border fence
      with Austria.[30] This encouraged East German citizens to start travelling
      to Hungary in the hope of being able to get to the west more easily, not
      only over the border, but also by going to the West German embassy in
      Budapest and seeking aslyum.[31] On 27 June 1989 the Hungarian foreign
      minister Gyula Horn and his Austrian counterpart Alois Mock symbolically
      cut the border fence just outside Sopron.[2][31] After the demolition of
      the border facilities, the patrols of the heavily armed Hungarian border
      guards were tightened and there was still a shooting order.[32][33] The
