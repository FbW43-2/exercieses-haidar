    <h1>What is a CSS Unit?</h1>
    <p class="p1">
      A CSS unit determines the size of a property you’re setting for an element
      or its content. For example, if you wanted to set the property margin of a
      paragraph, you would give it a specific value. This value includes the CSS
      unit.

    <h1>Absolute vs. Relative Units</h1>
    <h2>Absolute Units</h2>
    <p>
      Units that are “absolute” are the same size regardless of the parent
      element or window size. This means a property set with a value that has an
      absolute unit will be that size when looked at on a phone or on a large
      monitor (and everything in between!)
    </p>
    <h2>Relative Units</h2>
    <p class="p2">
      Relative units are useful for styling responsive sites because they scale
      relative to the parent or window size (depending on the unit).

      You can dig deeper into viewport units by reading this article, or have a
      look at this article about em vs rem units if the difference between those
      two units is still somewhat unclear.
